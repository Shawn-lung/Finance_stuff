## 3. Growth Prediction Analysis

### Industry Growth Projections (ML Model):

### Deep Learning Model Assessment:

## 4. Recommendations

1. **Deep Learning Model Issues**: The deep learning model shows problematic patterns including repeated values (particularly 0.01 and 0.3) across different stocks. Consider improving the model training process to capture more stock-specific patterns.

2. **Industry-Specific Patterns**: The valuation disparities between industries suggest a need for industry-specific calibration, especially for banking, semiconductor, and hardware sectors.

3. **Hardware and Electronic Stocks**: Companies in these sectors show particularly large discrepancies between standard DCF and ML-enhanced valuations, suggesting growth assumptions may need industry-specific adjustments.

4. **Ensemble Model Effectiveness**: The ML+DL ensemble model is not consistently improving upon the ML-only model, indicating the DL component needs further refinement before it adds value.
